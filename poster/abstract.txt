Hexagonal boron-nitride is a low density ceramic with a high melting point and a high electrical resisivity. Boron nitride exists as a hexagonal lattice, structurally similar to that of graphite with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms. In addition to its existence as a sheet, it can be rolled into nanotubes.  Unlike graphite, the chirality of the tube does not alter its electrical properties. At temperatures below 1273K, liquid aluminum does not wet the surface of boron-nitride, a necessary occurrence when designing boron-nitride-aluminum composites.  The effect of doping the boron-nitride sheet with other elements was investigated using a computational density functional theory approach.  Doping elements such as carbon, silicon and aluminum were all considered, as well as doping at both the boron and nitrogen sites.  The results from these experiments were compared to the undoped boron-nitride-aluminum system in order to observe a correlation between the wetting and the type and position of the dopant atoms.  In addition to boron-nitride sheets, boron-nitride nanotubes were considered.  ####TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT RESULTS ###
