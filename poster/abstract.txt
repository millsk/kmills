Hexagonal boron-nitride is a low density ceramic with a high melting point and a high electrical resisivity. Boron nitride exists as a hexagonal lattice, structurally similar to that of graphite with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms. In addition to its existence as a sheet, it can be rolled into nanotubes.  Unlike graphite, the chirality of the tube does not alter its electrical properties.  The
